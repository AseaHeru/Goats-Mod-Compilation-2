DESCRIPTION:

This mod adds new items, recipes, construction options, professions
buildings and enemies.
Most of the recipes allow players to use items that don't get much uses
so you will end up with less stuff lying around. On the other hand, this
also makes it so players might end up using resources with non essential
recipes if they are not careful.



The following list shows all the new items added in this mod:

///////////////
//Consumables

Wastebread:
"Flour is a commodity these days and to deal with that, most survivors
resort to mix it with leftovers of other ingredients and bake it all
into bread. It's filling, and that's what matters."

Boring Sandwich:
"A simple sauce sandwich. Not very filling but beats eating just the
bread."

Jam Sandwich:
"A delicious jam sandwich."

Cheese Sandwich:
"A simple cheese sandwich."

Grilled Cheese:
"A delicious looking grilled cheese. Because everything is better with
melted cheese."

"Usually consumed in the mornings, milk tea is common among many
countries."

Bark Tea:
"Often regarded as folk medicine in some countries, bark tea is not
only a tasty beverage but is also used to boost the immune system."

Honey Ball:
"Droplet shaped ant food. It's like a thick balloon the size of a
baseball, filled with sticky liquid. Unlike bee honey, this has mostly
a sour taste, probably because ants feed upon a variety of things."

Honeygold Brew:
"A mixed drink containing all the advantages of its ingredients and
none of their disadvantages. It tastes great and it's a good source of
nourishment."

Sewer Brew:
"A thirsty mutant's drink of choice. It tastes horrible but it's
probably a lot safer to drink than before."
