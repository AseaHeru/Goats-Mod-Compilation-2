Release date: 8Dec2016

Description: This is a test version of the mansion upgrade project. Since there is not yet a way to choose pieces of a complex at random and link them to specific z-levels pieces, this version only contains 4 possible configurations (except slight variations where pieces have identical footprints.)

How to use:
1.) Replace the data\mods\Z-Level_Buildings directory with this one.
2.) Genereate a new world with the "Tall Buildings" mod activated.
2.a.) Use whichever other settings you prefer.
2.b.) Mods that generate lots of special buildings will reduce the number of mansions.
2.c.) Activating experimental Z-levels is recommended but not necessary.
2.c.i) Pro: You will be able to climb up an down in some places.
2.c.ii) Con: Currently zombies will see you through the floors and ceilings.
3.) Play it and please give feed back at:
